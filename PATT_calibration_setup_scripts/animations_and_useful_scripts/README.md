The scripts here were test scripts that were written during the building of the PATT. cable mappings and other factors have changed since then

The animation scripts mostly work to show that control over the attenuations and delays are possible. It is a cool visualization as well.

There are scripts here that might be useful, most are not up to date or not set to the latest design. feel free to test them.
